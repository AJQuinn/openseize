    "In this document, we will introduce Producers, one of the primary building blocks of OpenSeize. Producers are an answer to the issue of loading in massive amounts of data into memory before performing analysis or other manipulations. They do so by taking in one of various forms of data and a desired chunksize, splitting the data into numpy arrays of that chunksize. Think of Producers as multipurpose PEZ Dispensers. You slot your input data in, along with the chunksize, to create a Producer object. This object can then spit out chunks one at a time, as you iterate over it using one of Python's many iterative methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we will show off how to use Producers to read in from the following data input types:\n",
    " - Numpy Arrays\n",
    " - Python Sequences\n",
    " - Binary Files (e.g. EDF Files)\n",
    " - Python Generator Functions\n",
    " - Other Producers\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these, we will also give examples of how to read / use them in practice.\n",
