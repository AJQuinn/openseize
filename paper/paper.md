# Summary
Electroencencepholgraphy (EEG) is an indispensable clinical and research
tool used to diagnose neurological disease and discover mechanism of normal
and abnornal cognitive functions. Mechanistically, EEGs are non-stationary
time-series that capture the ongoing changes of the brain's electromagnetic
field generated by millions of neurons synchronously communicating through
small electric potentials at their synapses. To understand these
time-series, linear digital signal processing (DSP) tools are routinely used
to reduce noise, resample the signal, remove artifacts, expose the signals
spatio-temporal frequency content, and much more. Importantly, current DSP
software packages make two critical assumptions. The first assumption is
that the signals to be analyzed are addressable to the analysis machines
memory and secondly that the result of the DSP process can also be stored to
memory. Advances in recording technologies over the past decade are rapidly
degrading these assumptions. In particular, thin-film electonics innovations
now allow for the deposition of a large number of electrode contacts onto
a single recording device that can be left implanted on the cortical surface
for months. A survey of the most popular DSP packages for neuroscientfic
research reveals that none are capable of scaling to long-duration and/or
high-channel number EEG datasets. Specifically, source-code examinations of
these packages all indicate reliance on Matlab's or Scipy's DSP functions
which necessitate in-memory arrays.
Opensieze, uses  functional programming in conjunction with command and
iterator design patterns to overcome these limitations. Specifically,
DSP operations in Openseize are encoded in
